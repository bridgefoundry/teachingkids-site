title: Fifth Grade Shoes
---
At the end of the school year I talk a series of 3 beginning programming lessons to a class of 30 fourth and fifth graders.  Only one or two of them had ever programmed before.  I chose to teach the Ruby language in the "Shoes" platform which provides rich graphics and native user interface controls. I've written up my experience of each class, including a fun physical demonstration of light as an introduction to RGB color: 
* [Lesson 1](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/05/teaching-ruby-to-kids-first-lesson/)
* [Lesson 2](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/05/teaching-kids-to-code-lesson-2/)
* [RGB Color demonstration](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/05/on-understanding-rgb-color/)
* [Lesson 3](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/05/teaching-kids-to-code-lesson-3/)

The programming exercises are posted [here](http://teachingkids.railsbridge.org/lessons.html) where anyone can use them as is or "fork" the documents and use these as a starting point.

If you find these useful or have other teaching experiences to share, please drop us a note on the [RailsBridge email list](http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge).
