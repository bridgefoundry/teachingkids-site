<p class='left'>The following environments and languages have been suggested as good for teaching kids</p>
<h3>Ruby</h3>
<ul>
  <li<a href="http://shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a> (Desktop apps for Mac, Win, Linux.  Easy to create graphics and get started quickly.)</li>
  <li>

    One teacher said this wasn't "fun & easy" enough for middle- and high-school kids, but great for motivated self-study.
