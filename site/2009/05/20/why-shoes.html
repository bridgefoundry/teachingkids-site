        <h1>Why Shoes?</h1>
        <p>The first RailsBridge teaching project is a short series introducing a 4th/5th grade class to programming. We decided to use <a href='http://shoooes.net/'>Shoes</a> and the Ruby programming language.</p>

<p>To quote one <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge/msg/2c41610f8cc570b4?hl=en'>Railsbrige comment</a> Kids want to learn something that is:</p>

<p>A. Fun</p>

<p>B. Easy</p>

<p>Ok, maybe Ruby isn&#8217;t so easy, but relative to a lot of modern programming languages it is pretty good. There is very little &#8220;boilerplate.&#8221; Programs are fairly concise and to the point. I wouldn&#8217;t touch Javascript for kids since the implementations are so inconsistent. Kids can deal with rules as long as they are clearly explained and consistent.</p>

<p>Also, Ruby is a &#8220;real&#8221; programming language that real-world programmers use for practical purposes. It is effective to teach kids skills that adults use. When I did research for establishing the curriculum goals for our elementary school, I read a lot about &#8220;21st century learning skills&#8221; where kids learn to use computers and other tech as tools, in the similar manner to how adults use those tools (beyond using &#8220;educational software&#8221; for teaching specific subjects). I find from personal experience that kids are very motivated when they are learning something that could have application outside of the classroom.</p>
